# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

- I wanted to create a random password gerator to better understand JavaScript.
- This I will be able to us to better protect myself with new passwords.
- I learned that with a complicated piece of code like this I like to jump to the end and need to slow down with psuedo coding and take it step by step.
- I learned a lot by getting tutor sessions with Rebecca Burke and Sandy Smith to help create the prompts and fix my for loop as well as have them explain that I was close but missing certain concat's with generating the password as well as fixing my for loop to start at the 1 index instead of the 0.
